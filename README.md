## Football Dashboard

This is a simple Dashboard created from open football historical results data published by https://www.football-data.co.uk/. These data dowloaded directly from the website, are then processed to create two main outputs:

-[Teams_Result_DB.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisNaudin/Football-Dashboard/master/backend/Football_DB/Teams_Result_DB.csv) with detailed historical results per team.

-[Computed_Ranking.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisNaudin/Football-Dashboard/master/backend/Football_DB/Computed_Ranking.csv) correspond to historical and current ranking computed from the results. For each league, the ranking of each team is computed for every date a match occured.
